The black Robot represents the estimated position and the red Robot represents the actual
position.

Landmarks are represented by *.
Waypoints are represented by +. (the green + represents the waypoint the robot is trying to reach.
And the path is represented by a dash line ---.

The plot on the right side represents the trajectory of both the estimated (black) and actual (red).  A green line is created perpendicular to the trajectory showing the trace of P.

To start the program:
1. Select LocalizationGUI.m and press the run button.
2. Press on the Open Data File button, select a data file and run the simulation.

Other data file can be created.
