The black Robot represents the estimated position and the red Robot represents the actual
position.

Landmarks are represented by *.
Waypoints are represented by +. (the green + represents the waypoint the robot is trying to reach.
And the path is represented by a dash line ---.

The plot on the right side represents the trajectory of both the estimated (black) and actual (red).  A green line is created perpendicular to the trajectory showing the trace of P.

To start the program select LocalizationGUI.m and press the run button.
Press on the Open Data File button, select a data file and run the simulation.

Other data file can be created.
